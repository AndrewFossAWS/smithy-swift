# Example Code Generated by smithy-kotlin

This project is a **sandbox** for what the code generated by a Smithy model **might** look like for the Kotlin code generator. 
It is all hand written and everything is subject to change.


NOTE:
* The `.smithy` models would not be included in a generated model. They are here for reference
* The `client-runtime` library is not generated but it doesn't exist yet. It's included here so we can see what those interfaces might look like. It will end up being a dependency in the build files and pulled from one of the public repositories
* Anything marked with a TODO/FIXME is likely a spot where we know something won't be that way or will be tweaked
* The Gradle build files will likely need tweaked or additional options. Right now it is shown as a top level (root) project. For the actual AWS SDK's this wouldn't be the case, we would generate them as sub-projects.
* Nothing in here is Android specific. It also shouldn't need to be at this level. The `smithy-kotlin` code generator _is not_ Android specific. The AWS SDK code generator that sits on top will add the correct runtime engine.
